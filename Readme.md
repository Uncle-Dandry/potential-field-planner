# Potential Field Planner for Multi-Robot Coordination

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Potential Field Planner for multi-robot trajectory planning. The planner is designed to coordinate the movement of a group of robots in a three-dimensional environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching target points. The implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts of potential fields, where robots are attracted to target points and repelled from obstacles, including other robots.

**Note:** This project is an amateur implementation for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.

## Features

- **Trajectory Planning:** Plans safe paths for multiple robots from start to goal points, avoiding obstacles.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** In this project, potential fields for obstacles are represented by calculating repulsive forces that push robots away from obstacles. Obstacles are approximated as point sources during the calculation to simplify the interaction. The overall force acting on each robot is computed as the vector sum of virtual repulsive forces from obstacles and attractive forces towards the goal, taking into account the distances between the robot, obstacles, and goal. 
- **Local Minimum Handling:** Detects and escapes local minima situations where robots are trapped.
- **Group Behavior:** Supports leader-following (`follow`) and distance maintenance (`maintain_distance`) within a robot group.
- **Random Scene Generation:** Includes a feature (`random_obs`) to generate random obstacles in the environment (works imperfectly).
- **3D Visualization:** Provides visualization of the planned trajectories in a 3D environment.

## Installation

To use the Potential Field Planner, you need Python installed. The following Python packages are required:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Uncle-Dandry/potential-field-planner.git
   cd potential-field-planner
   ```

2. **Configure the Simulation:**
   Edit the `config.py` file to set the parameters of the simulation, such as the number of robots, obstacle positions, start and goal points, and other settings. 

3. **Run Predefined Experiments:**
   The file `main.py` demonstrates the capabilities of the planner. Run it using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Run a Custom Simulation:**
   You can create a custom scenario or experiment by modifying the settings in `config.py` and `experiments.py` or directly within your Python scripts.

5. **Random Scene Generation:**
   Use the `random_obs` flag to generate a random scene with obstacles. Note that this feature is not fully reliable and may produce unexpected results.

6. **Group Behavior Control:**
   - Use the `follow` flag to enable a leader-following behavior among the robots.
   - Use the `maintain_distance` flag to enforce distance maintenance within the group.

## Code Structure

- `config.py`: Configuration file for setting parameters.
- `experiments.py`: Script containing predefined scenarios for demonstration.
- `graphics.py`: Functions for visualizing robots' trajectories and the environment.
- `local_minimum.py`: Contains functions for handling local minimum within the potential field. Adds a virtual obstacle at the midpoint of the local minimum.
- `main.py`: The main script to run simulations.
- `polyhedral_obstacles.py`: Provides functionality for handling polyhedral obstacles.
  - `compute_nearest_obstacle_from_point`: Computes the nearest point on the polyhedral obstacle to a given robot position, allowing for the obstacle to be approximated as a sphere.
- `potential_field_planner.py`: Core implementation of the potential field algorithm.
- `robot_trajectory.py`: Includes functions to calculate and update the robotâ€™s trajectory. This file handles the generation of new trajectory points considering the current robot state and environment conditions.
- `smooth_path.py`: Implements path smoothing using linear interpolation.
- `tools.py`: Utility functions for calculations and helpers.
